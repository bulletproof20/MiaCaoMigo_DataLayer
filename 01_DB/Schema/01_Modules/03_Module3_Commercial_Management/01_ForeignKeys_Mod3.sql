-- MODULE 3: FOREIGN KEYS (COMMERCIAL MANAGEMENT)
--=========================================================
--
-- Deferred and cross-module FKs for commercial entities live here
-- so that all tables (Modules 1–4) exist before linking.
--
-- Order respects circular links between product, stock, purchase,
-- and return (same semantics as previous end-of-file ALTER block).
